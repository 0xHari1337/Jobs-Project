# Jobs Management App (React)

This project is a simple jobs management application built using React, where job details are retrieved from a local instance of json-server. Each job is stored as a JSON object, and the app allows users to view, add, edit, and delete job listings. The displayed jobs include information such as job titles, descriptions, salary, and locations, and users can interact with the listings through an intuitive interface. 

This project demonstrates CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and showcases how React interacts with a local REST API.
